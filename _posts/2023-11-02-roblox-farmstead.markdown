In this post I will show and explain certain details of the game „[Farmstead][roblox-farmstead]“ which can be played for free on Roblox. I will share my experiences after a couple of weeks playing extensively. Hint: I did not have to spend a dollar on it yet.

I would describe Farmstead as a typical farming game with capabilities to raise animals and crops while leveling up your own character by doing tasks around your own abilities and skills. The farm land can be expanded and designed to your own needs and wantings with both functional objects as well as pure decorative ones.

The best: Up to this post the game is under active development and is truly one of the best and complete farming games on Roblox.

What makes it so great:
- While collecting experience on several skill attributes you will unlock new shop items at each level reached. There are 10 base levels on 6 skills: Cooking, Farming, Fishing, Foraging, Mining and Woodcutting.
- Yes, there is a diamond currency in the game but you will not be bugged to really buy more.
- The farm land starts with an island, there are 3 main extensions which can be unlocked with ingame coins and a secret cave additionally which unlocks after the character reached 30 skill levels in total.
- The game glances with various crops, fruits and vegetables, trees and animals.
- Each crop takes a few minutes to fully grow and become ready to be collected/harvested.
- Animals can be purchased and a male and female combined can breed a new type. If you follow the breeding guide you can breed rare combinations and sell them for more coins. It can be an even better way of earning in compare to pure crops farming.

I started like everyone else and bought crop seeds for the farming land and sell its produce as well at the in-town merchant. As soon as my farming level increased (which happens quite fast at start) I was able to afford better seeds and could grow on larger farmland in parallel. If you have friends, you can ask them for seeds which you cannot buy yet (due to your skill level). If they are kind and drop or exchange them with you, you can grow them and make money faster. Most seeds earn you double what you paid for them. So it is worth to check back the stats of the seeds once you unlocked a new one.

I learnt that cacao is probably the best income seed but it is required to be seeded on the tropical area of your island only. Before that pumpkins are a good income, as they are seeded on the mountain area which is kind of large. As soon as you have a lot of land and enough money, you can go into animal farming. In an example: With up to 150 animals in total (a limit set by the game creator) you could theoretically end up making 50 pairs of male and female horses, mix a gender type of Clydesdale with the opposite gender of Holsteiner horse and produce a Friesian foal. With horses almost every 10 minutes a new horse is born and could be sold directly for 4,000 coins or 8,000 coins if grown up. In this example you could with 50 parallel breedings of this type theoretically make up to 200,000-400,000 couns every 10 minutes plus time to fill up the food and water places.

Best incomes compared:
- Cacao: It costs 180 coins per crop and it can be sold for 500 coins. Only disadvantage is that it only grows on the limited tropical land. And it requires the tropical area to be unlocked for 2,500,000 coins.
- Pumpkin: You can plant this on the mountain area which are is probably the largest one. Buy for 120 coins and sell for 300 coins. Requires the mountain area to be unlocked for 200,000 coins.
- Friesian horse: The most expensive animal in the current line-up. The challenge is to raise previous horse classes before and produce yourself a stock of breeding horses which continuesly produce a new horse with just some food and water. Buy white and brown horses first (2 horses are needed at least, better to start with 4), sell Friesian horses for up to 8,000 coins. A foal takes 25 minutes to grow up and double its price from 4,000 to 8,000 coins.
